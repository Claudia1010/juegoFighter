### FSD Game Proyect


This is my third project of GeeksHubs Academy FSD bootcamp. The objective is to design a basic SPA (Single Page Aplication) videogame using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript Vanilla.

This project is a fight game with the option to choose between 4 different characters. After selecting the characters, there is a button "START!" to start playing. This button is going to return a random number, that is going to reduce the life of the selected characters. When the life of any of the characters is equal to 0, is going to show up the last screen with the image and name of the winner.

Therefore the game contains 4 screens: The first one screen, the home page.

The second one, to select the characters.
